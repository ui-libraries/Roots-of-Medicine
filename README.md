From the original text on the home page...

> Roots of Medicine is an interdisciplinary project featuring a collaboration between the [College of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.uiowa.edu/), [Hardin Library for the Health Sciences](https://www.lib.uiowa.edu/hardin/), and community members. It joins the College of Pharmacy garden you see before you with historical resources from the [John R. Martin Rare Book]() Room at the [Hardin Library for the Health Sciences](https://www.lib.uiowa.edu/hardin/) and databases from the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/). Each plant has an identification tag with the common name, species name, and a QR code. If you point your phone’s camera at the QR code and click the link that appears, you will be taken to a webpage with information on the plant’s historical and modern medicinal uses and a feed of the most current research. We invite you to walk the garden, take a journey through time, and explore the Roots of Medicine!
